# iMessage-Twitch-Stickers
Twitch Stickers for iMessages on iOS10.

Because the sticker functionality in iMessages for iOS10 allows users to scale and drag the stickers anywhere they want some of these emotes might be very low quality cause there is no higher quality version to be found.
Currently it only has the 'Global Emotes' but it wouldn't be that hard to get Subscriber emotes too.

DISCLAIMER: I used a simple static bash script to download the images from the twitchemotes servers. I am not adding it to the repository because I don't want people to download it and massively download the images from there.

All emotes are downloaded from [TwitchEmotes](https://twitchemotes.com/)
I did not create any of these emotes
